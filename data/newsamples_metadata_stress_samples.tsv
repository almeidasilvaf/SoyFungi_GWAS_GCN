Sequencing library was used to produce clusters for a 1 x 100 bp single end-sequencing run into one lane on a flow cell for sequencing in a Hi-Seq 2000 (Illumina)."

NA	NA	NA	NA	SAMN02324424	PRJNA165677	embryo	Soybean early maturation-stage embryonic axis part	NA	Methylation Changes in Soybean Early Maturation Seed Parts	Seeds are comprised of three majors parts of distinct parental origin: the seed coat, embryo, and endosperm.  The maternally-derived seed coat is important for nurturing and protecting the seeds during development.  By contrast, the embryo and the endosperm are derived from a double fertilization event, where one sperm fertilizes the egg to form the diploid zygote and the other sperm fertilizes the central cell to form the triploid endosperm.  Each seed parts undergo distinct developmental programs during seed development.  What methylation changes occurring in the different seed parts, if any, remains unknown. To uncover the possible role of DNA methylation in different parts of the seed, we characterized the methylome of three major parts of an early maturation stage seed: seed coat, embryonic cotyledons, and embryonic axis using Illumina sequencing. Overall design: Illumina sequencing of bisulfite-converted genomic DNA, transcripts, and small RNAs from three parts of an early maturation stage seed: seed coat (EM-SC), embryonic cotyledons (EM-COT), and embryonic axis (EM-AX).

Using a transgenic hairy root system, we demonstrated that over-expression of GmPHD6 improved stress tolerance in transgenic soybean composites. Perhaps due to the excessive amount of LHP1 compared to that of GmPHD6, over-expression of LHP1-1/2 failed to do so. The integrity of the complex is essential in stress response, for the abrogation of DNA binding activity of GmPHD6 or the decrease of LHP1 content leads to stress sensitivity in soybean. GmPHD6 influences expression of dozens of stress-related genes to confer stress tolerance. Among these genes, we identified three direct targets of GmPHD6, ASR (ABA-stress-ripening induced), CYP71A22 (cytochrome P450) and CYP82C4. Our study reveals significant findings in stress response. GmPHD6 and LHP1 are recruited to H3K4me0/1/2 marks, where several stress-related genes may locate in, to form a transcriptional activation complex. GmPHD6 locates target sites through recognizing the G-rich elements in their promoters; LHP1 enhances expression levels of these targets. Genetically engineering of GmPHD6/LHP1 complex should improve stress tolerance in crop plants.

To better understand resistance mechanisms, we conducted RNA-Seq of P. gregata infected and mock infected leaf, stem, and root tissues of both a resistant (PI 437970, Rbs3) and a susceptible (Corsoy 79) soybean genotype. Samples were collected one-week post infection. Our bioinformatic analyses focused on treatment, genotype, and treatment by genotype effects on gene expression

One fascinating aspect of plant pathogen co-evolution is that pathogens use effectors to alter a broad range of host responses. RNA splicing functions in many physiological processes including plant immunity. However, how plant pathogens manipulate host RNA splicing process remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that PsAvr3c, an avirulence effector from oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae, physically binds to and stabilizes soybean (Glycine max) serine/arginine/lysine rich proteins GmSRKPs in vivo. SRKP, novel proteins associating with spliceosome components, are plant susceptibility factors against Phytophthora. Furthermore, RNA-seq data uncovers that differential splicing over one thousand soybean mRNA transcripts, including defense related genes, are significantly changed in GmSRKP1 over-expressing lines. Representative splicing events are verified in either infection assay or soybean transient expression assay. Our results demonstrate that plant pathogen utilize effector to reprogram host RNA splicing, uncovering a new strategy evolved by pathogens to defeat host immune system Overall design: Two independent soybean GFP-GmSRKP1 over-expression lines and one GFP control sample

Thus far, our knowledge of the dynamic epigenomic during tissue culture is limited. In this study, we generated epigenomes from nine different stages throughout the tissue culture process and found significant genome-wide increases of DNA methylation throughout the soybean genome. This change mostly happens in CHH (H = A, T, C) context and targets transposable elements (TEs). Subsequent analyses of corresponding transcriptomes and small RNA distributions indicate that it is associated with high activity of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. These results provide important insights into the function of a dynamic epigenome throughout tissue culture and extends our understanding of epigenome-wide reprogramming of the DNA methylome in plants.

NA	NA	NA	NA	SAMN07337674	PRJNA393573	root	soybean	NA	RNA-seq data of soybean SKRP1 and AVR3C	The process of RNA splicing influences many physiological processes including plant immunity. However, how plant parasites manipulate host RNA splicing process remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that PsAvr3c, an avirulence effector from oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora sojae, physically binds to and stabilizes soybean (Glycine max) serine/lysine/arginine rich proteins GmSKRPs in vivo. The SKRPs are novel proteins that associate with spliceosome components, and are negative regulators of plant immunity. Analysis by RNA-seq data indicates that alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs from 401 soybean genes, including defense related genes, is altered in GmSKRP1 and PsAvr3c over-expressing lines compared to control plants. Representative splicing events mediated by GmSKRP1 and PsAvr3c are tested by infection assays or by transient expression in soybean plants. Our results show that a plant pathogen effector can reprogram host pre-mRNA splicing to promote disease, and we propose that pathogens evolved such strategies to defeat host immune systems. Overall design: three independent soybean SKRP1 over-expression lines, three AVR3C over-expression samples and three GFP control samples

abiotic	phosphorus	NA	control	SAMN07703164	PRJNA412240	leaves	leaves	NA	Transcriptomic study of soybean (Glycine max) leaves in response to short-term phosphorus deficiency	We conducted a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis in soybean leaves treated with a short-term (24 h) Pi-deficiency using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. Two biological replicates of RNA-seq were included for both Pi-sufficient leaves (PSL) and Pi-deficient leaves (PDL), and therefore a total of four libraries were constructed. Using a 2-fold change and a P-value ≤0.05 as the cut-off for selecting the differentially expressed transcripts, we globally identified short-term Pi-stress responsive genes. Some DEGs potentially involved in Pi sensing, signaling, and homeostasis were up-regulated by Pi deprivation, including five SPX-containing genes. Some DEGs possibly associated with water and nutrient uptake, hormonal and calcium signaling, protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and cell wall modification were affected at the early stage of Pi deprivation. At least thirty-one transcription factor genes belonging to 10 diverse families were found to be responsive to Pi starvation. Overall design: The first trifoliate true leaves of soybean were harvested after 24 h treatment with or without phosphate, and RNA was extracted and sequenced by paired-end sequencing. RNA sequencing reads were aligned against the soybean reference genome and differentially expressed genes between treatments were detected.

This time series dataset enables us to identify important hubs and connection of gene expressions. We highlighted the analysis of phytohormone signaling pathways and their possible cross-talking. Gene expression regulation also controls adjustment of carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In general, the treated seedlings had turned off the photosynthetic mechanism and enhanced sugar catabolism to provide energy for survival. Primary nitrogen assimilation was shut down while re-distribution of nitrogen resources was activated. Genes for other protective mechanisms were also induced, including structural modification, ion-sequestering, and scavenging of reactive oxygen species.

abiotic	zinc	NA	stress	SAMN08707418	PRJNA438169	leaves	Zn deficient leaves	without zinc element in the nutrient solution	Transcriptomic study of soybean (Glycine max) in response to zinc deficiency	We conducted a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis in soybean leaves and roots treated with zinc (Zn) deficiency using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. Two biological replicates of RNA-seq were included for Zn-sufficient leaves (ZSL), Zn-deficient leaves (ZDL), Zn-sufficient roots (ZSR), and Zn-deficient roots (ZDR). Therefore a total of eight libraries were constructed. Using a 2-fold change and a P-value ≤0.05 as the cut-off for selecting the differentially expressed transcripts, we globally identified Zn-deficiency responsive genes. At least 20 genes that are potentially involved Zn homeostasis were significantly changed by Zn deficiency, including 7 ZIP (ZRT, IRT-related protein) transporter genes, 3 nicotianamine synthase genes, and 7 metallothionein genes. At least 48 genes encoding likely Zn-binding proteins were found to be responsive to Zn deficiency in leaves or roots. Eighty-five transcription factor genes were significantly changed by Zn deficiency in leaves or roots, including 5 bZIP members and 10 Golden 2-like members. In addition, some other groups of genes which are possibly related to reactive oxygen species scavenging, calcium and hormone signaling, and protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation also differentially expressed under Zn deficiency. Overall design: The first trifoliate true leaves and roots of soybean were harvested after 12 days treatment with or without zinc element in the nutrient solution, and RNA was extracted and sequenced by paired-end sequencing. RNA sequencing reads were aligned against the soybean reference genome and differentially expressed genes between treatments were detected.

abiotic	phosphorus	NA	stress	SAMN09539559	PRJNA479468	nodule	Nodule	NA	Genome wide transcriptome analysis reveals complex regulatory mechanisms underlying phosphate homeostasis in soybean nodules	Phosphorus (P) deficiency is a major limitation for legume crop production. Although overall adaptations of plant roots to P deficiency have been extensively studied, fragmentary information is available in regards to root nodule responses to P deficiency. In this study, genome wide transcriptome analysis was conducted using RNA-seq analysis to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying soybean (Glycine max) nodule adaptation to phosphate (Pi) starvation. Phosphorus deficiency significantly decreased soybean nodule growth and nitrogenase activity. Nodule Pi concentrations declined by 49% in response to P deficiency, but this was well below the 87% and 88% decreases observed in shoots and roots, respectively. Nodule transcript profiling revealed that a total of 2,055 genes exhibited differential expression patterns between Pi sufficient and deficient conditions. A set of DEGs appeared to be involved in maintaining Pi homeostasis in soybean nodules, including 8 Pi transporters (PTs), 8 proteins containing the SYG1/PHO81/XPR1 domain (SPXs), and 16 purple acid phosphatases (PAPs). The results suggest that a complex transcriptional regulatory network participates in soybean nodule adaption to Pi starvation, most notable a Pi signaling pathway specifically involved in maintaining Pi homeostasis in nodules. Overall design: Soybean seedlings were inoculated with rhizobium, then transferred into nutrient solution containing 500 mM KH2PO4 (HP) or 25 mM KH2PO4 (LP). After 25 days, nodules with the size more than 3 mm were collected for mRNA library construction and sequencing. Nodules from two plants were pooled together as one replicate, and three replicates from each P treatment were used for RNA-seq analysis.

NA	NA	NA	NA	SAMN09690628	PRJNA481793	flower	NA	NA	Transcriptomic comparison reveals genetic variation potentially underlying seed developmental evolution of soybeans	Soybean (Glycine max) was domesticated from its wild relative Glycine soja. However, the genetic variations underlying soybean domestication are not well known. Comparative transcriptomics revealed that a small portion of the orthologous genes might have been fast-evolving. In contrast, three gene expression clusters were identified as divergent by their expression patterns, which occupied 37.44% of the total genes, hinting at an essential role for gene expression alteration in soybean domestication. Moreover, the most divergent stage in gene expression between wild and cultivated soybeans occurred during seed development around the cotyledon stage (15 days after fertilization, G15). A module in which the coexpressed genes were significantly downregulated at G15 of wild soybeans was identified. The divergent clusters and modules included substantial differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wild and cultivated soybeans related to cell division, storage compound accumulation, hormone-response, and seed maturation processes. Chromosomal-linked DEGs, quantitative trait loci controlling seed weight and oil content, and selection sweeps revealed candidate DEGs at G15 in the fruit-related divergence of G. max and G. soja. Our work establishes a transcriptomic selection mechanism for altering gene expression during soybean domestication, thus shedding light on the molecular networks underlying soybean seed development and breeding strategy.

The divergent clusters and modules included substantial differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wild and cultivated soybeans related to cell division, storage compound accumulation, hormone-response, and seed maturation processes. Chromosomal-linked DEGs, quantitative trait loci controlling seed weight and oil content, and selection sweeps revealed candidate DEGs at G15 in the fruit-related divergence of G. max and G. soja. Our work establishes a transcriptomic selection mechanism for altering gene expression during soybean domestication, thus shedding light on the molecular networks underlying soybean seed development and breeding strategy.

However, the genetic variations underlying soybean domestication are not well known. Comparative transcriptomics revealed that a small portion of the orthologous genes might have been fast-evolving. In contrast, three gene expression clusters were identified as divergent by their expression patterns, which occupied 37.44% of the total genes, hinting at an essential role for gene expression alteration in soybean domestication.

In this study, we have identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between shattering-resistant and shattering-susceptible soybean accessions based on transcriptome analyses of 10 soybean accessions. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may be involved in soybean pod dehiscence were also identified, and we constructed co-expression networks between mRNAs and lncRNAs. RNA sequencing results were further verified by real-time PCR. Furthermore, DEGs were screened through analyzing positions of soybean pod dehiscence quantitative trait locus (QTLs) and phenotypes of soybean pod dehiscence for achieving pod-dehiscence candidate genes.

biotic	fungus	Pgregata	control_12h	SAMN12040107	PRJNA548564	leaves	NA	Mock	Soybean response to brown stem rot fungus infection	Brown stem rot (BSR), caused by the fungus Phialophora gregata, reduces yield by 38%. Three dominant BSR resistance loci have been identified: Rbs1, Rbs2, and Rbs3. All three genes have been mapped to large, overlapping regions on soybean chromosome 16 though the gene networks regulating resistance remain unknown. Further, identifying resistant germplasm by genotyping or phenotyping remains difficult due to complexities of soybean/P. gregata interactions. To aid in identifying and characterizing soybean resistance genes, novel approaches bridging the gap between breeding and genomics are needed. To identify genes and gene networks important in the resistant response, I conducted RNA-Seq of leaf, stem, and root tissues collected 12, 24, and 36 hours after P. gregata or mock-infection of a Rbs3 resistant soybean genotype. I identified genes differentially expressed in response to infection (treatment) at each time point.

Current research shows that R genes predominantly function by inducing a hypersensitive reaction (HR), which results in localized cell death thought to restrict pathogen spread. Some R genes elicit a more atypical response where resistance is not associated with HR or the associated gene expression changes, termed extreme resistance (ER). The molecular regulatory mechanism underlying ER is largely unexplored. One of the few known, naturally occurring, instances of ER is resistance derived from the soybean Rsv3 gene, which confers resistance against the most virulent strains of soybean mosaic virus (SMV). To discern the regulatory mechanism underlying the Rsv3-mediated ER reaction, we generated a gene regulatory network using transcriptomic data from a time course comparison of SMV-G7-infected resistant (L29, Rsv3-genotype) and susceptible (Williams82, rsv3-genotype) soybean cultivars. We identified putative interactions between transcription factors (TFs) regulating gene expression in hormone regulatory pathways, such as abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA). This is consistent with the demonstrated involvement of these pathways in Rsv3-mediated resistance. We found significant enrichment for the G-box motif (“CACGTG”) among genes implicated in ABA- and JA-related activities. This motif is specifically recognized by MYC2, which is a master regulator of ABA and JA signaling. Our network identified a MYC2 TF encoded by Glyma.07G051500 as a putative transcriptional regulator whose expression was significantly down-regulated in L29. This correlated with the down-regulation of expression of genes involved in ABA and JA processes. Our results suggest an important function for Glyma.07G051500 in ABA and JA derived defense signaling. Additionally, our regulatory network found other putative TFs with differential expression, such as MYBs and ERFs, which may also be involved in regulating ABA and JA signaling for defense. The regulatory network presented here offers new insights into the regulation of the molecular defense mechanism underlying Rsv3-mediated ER against SMV. Overall design: The soybean cultivars ‘L29’ (Rsv3-genotype; resistant) and ‘Williams82’ (rsv3-genotype; susceptible) were used in this study. The Rsv3-genotype confers ER to the most virulent strains of SMV. Thus the goal of this study was to investigate the regulation of the Rsv3-mediated ER molecular defense mechanism against SMV. Plants were grown in controlled greenhouse conditions and inoculated at first, fully, expanded trifoliolate stage with SMV strain G7 (SMV-G7). Unifoliolate leaves were dusted with carborundum powder and rubbed with SMV-G7 inoculum. The inoculated unifoliolate leaves were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post inoculation (hpi) and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. High-quality total RNA (RNA >7.0) was extracted from frozen samples using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) with on-column DNase digestion (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). A total of 20 mRNA libraries (= 2 cultivars x 5 time-points x 2 biological replicates) were prepared from duplicate RNA samples of each line at each time point and sequenced as 150PE with Illumina HiSeq4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at Novogene, Sacramento, CA."

We found significant enrichment for the G-box motif (“CACGTG”) among genes implicated in ABA- and JA-related activities. This motif is specifically recognized by MYC2, which is a master regulator of ABA and JA signaling. Our network identified a MYC2 TF encoded by Glyma.07G051500 as a putative transcriptional regulator whose expression was significantly down-regulated in L29. This correlated with the down-regulation of expression of genes involved in ABA and JA processes. Our results suggest an important function for Glyma.07G051500 in ABA and JA derived defense signaling. Additionally, our regulatory network found other putative TFs with differential expression, such as MYBs and ERFs, which may also be involved in regulating ABA and JA signaling for defense. The regulatory network presented here offers new insights into the regulation of the molecular defense mechanism underlying Rsv3-mediated ER against SMV. Overall design: The soybean cultivars ‘L29’ (Rsv3-genotype; resistant) and ‘Williams82’ (rsv3-genotype; susceptible) were used in this study. The Rsv3-genotype confers ER to the most virulent strains of SMV. Thus the goal of this study was to investigate the regulation of the Rsv3-mediated ER molecular defense mechanism against SMV. Plants were grown in controlled greenhouse conditions and inoculated at first, fully, expanded trifoliolate stage with SMV strain G7 (SMV-G7). Unifoliolate leaves were dusted with carborundum powder and rubbed with SMV-G7 inoculum. The inoculated unifoliolate leaves were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post inoculation (hpi) and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. High-quality total RNA (RNA >7.0) was extracted from frozen samples using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) with on-column DNase digestion (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). A total of 20 mRNA libraries (= 2 cultivars x 5 time-points x 2 biological replicates) were prepared from duplicate RNA samples of each line at each time point and sequenced as 150PE with Illumina HiSeq4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at Novogene, Sacramento, CA."

biotic	virus	SMV	stress_6hpi_res	SAMN12727380	PRJNA564957	leaves	SMV-G7 inoculated leaves	NA	A Transcriptional Regulatory Network of Rsv3-mediated Extreme Resistance Against Soybean Mosaic Virus	"Resistance (R) genes are very effective for disease control in plants. Current research shows that R genes predominantly function by inducing a hypersensitive reaction (HR), which results in localized cell death thought to restrict pathogen spread. Some R genes elicit a more atypical response where resistance is not associated with HR or the associated gene expression changes, termed extreme resistance (ER). The molecular regulatory mechanism underlying ER is largely unexplored. One of the few known, naturally occurring, instances of ER is resistance derived from the soybean Rsv3 gene, which confers resistance against the most virulent strains of soybean mosaic virus (SMV). To discern the regulatory mechanism underlying the Rsv3-mediated ER reaction, we generated a gene regulatory network using transcriptomic data from a time course comparison of SMV-G7-infected resistant (L29, Rsv3-genotype) and susceptible (Williams82, rsv3-genotype) soybean cultivars. We identified putative interactions between transcription factors (TFs) regulating gene expression in hormone regulatory pathways, such as abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA). This is consistent with the demonstrated involvement of these pathways in Rsv3-mediated resistance. We found significant enrichment for the G-box motif (“CACGTG”) among genes implicated in ABA- and JA-related activities. This motif is specifically recognized by MYC2, which is a master regulator of ABA and JA signaling. Our network identified a MYC2 TF encoded by Glyma.07G051500 as a putative transcriptional regulator whose expression was significantly down-regulated in L29. This correlated with the down-regulation of expression of genes involved in ABA and JA processes. Our results suggest an important function for Glyma.07G051500 in ABA and JA derived defense signaling. Additionally, our regulatory network found other putative TFs with differential expression, such as MYBs and ERFs, which may also be involved in regulating ABA and JA signaling for defense. The regulatory network presented here offers new insights into the regulation of the molecular defense mechanism underlying Rsv3-mediated ER against SMV. Overall design: The soybean cultivars ‘L29’ (Rsv3-genotype; resistant) and ‘Williams82’ (rsv3-genotype; susceptible) were used in this study. The Rsv3-genotype confers ER to the most virulent strains of SMV. Thus the goal of this study was to investigate the regulation of the Rsv3-mediated ER molecular defense mechanism against SMV. Plants were grown in controlled greenhouse conditions and inoculated at first, fully, expanded trifoliolate stage with SMV strain G7 (SMV-G7).

During such symbiosis, plants provide bacteria with preferred carbon sources such as malate and succinate in return for essential reduced nitrogen. Compatible interactions result in a series of plant root modifications that eventually result in nodule formation. Bacteria living in the nodule cells fix nitrogen via the nitrogenase enzyme complex. Interestingly, as in plant-pathogen interactions, incompatibility in legume-rhizobia associations is also regulated in a genotype-specific manner. For example, the dominant Rj2 gene is presumed to help exclude poor nitrogen-fixing or less-beneficial rhizobia such as B. japonicum USDA122 (U122). The process likely involves recognition of bacterial effectors by host receptor proteins similar to the perception of pathogenic microbes. Our results show that genetic exclusion of incompatible rhizobia in the root requires conserved molecular components of the plant immune response pathway and results in the induction of systemic signaling in the distal tissue. To better understand the mechanism underlying incompatible rhizobia-induced systemic signaling, we compared the transcriptional changes in the foliar tissue of Rj2 plants inoculated with compatible or incompatible rhizobia strains, using RNA-Seq analysis. Overall design: Overall, 1 control (mock), 2 treatments (treated with Incompatible Glycine max L76-1988 with Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA122 and Glycine max L76-1988 with Sinorhizobium fredii USDA257), each with 3 replicates.

However, the mechanism for aphid resistance in soybean is remain enigmatic, very little information is available about the different mechanisms between antibiosis and antixenosis genotypes. Here we dissected aphid infestation into three stages and used genome-wide gene expression profiling to investigate the underlying aphid-plant interaction mechanisms. Approximately 990 million raw reads in total were obtained, the high expression correlation in each genotype between infestation and non-infestation indicated that the response to aphid was controlled by a small subset of important genes. Moreover, plant response to aphid infestation was more rapid in resistant genotypes. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), a total of 901 transcription factor (TF) genes categorized to 40 families were identified with distinct expression patterns, of which AP2/ERF, MYB and WRKY families were proposed to playing dominated roles. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that these genes had either similar or distinct expression patterns in genotypes. Besides, JA-responsive pathway was domination in aphid-soybean interaction compared to SA pathway, which was not involved plant response to aphid in susceptible and antixenotic genotypes but played an important role in antibiosis one. Throughout, callose were deposited in all genotypes but it was more rapidly and efficiently in antibiotic one. However, reactive oxygen species were not involved in response to aphid attack in resistant genotypes during aphid infestation. Our study helps uncover important genes associated with aphid-attack response in antibiosis and antixenotic genotypes of soybean.

Besides, JA-responsive pathway was domination in aphid-soybean interaction compared to SA pathway, which was not involved plant response to aphid in susceptible and antixenotic genotypes but played an important role in antibiosis one. Throughout, callose were deposited in all genotypes but it was more rapidly and efficiently in antibiotic one. However, reactive oxygen species were not involved in response to aphid attack in resistant genotypes during aphid infestation. Our study helps uncover important genes associated with aphid-attack response in antibiosis and antixenotic genotypes of soybean. Overall design: mRNA profiles of aphid-susceptible, antibiotic and antixenotic soybean genotypes in 24h, 48h and 96h after infestation generated using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform, in triplicate

Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), a total of 901 transcription factor (TF) genes categorized to 40 families were identified with distinct expression patterns, of which AP2/ERF, MYB and WRKY families were proposed to playing dominated roles. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that these genes had either similar or distinct expression patterns in genotypes. Besides, JA-responsive pathway was domination in aphid-soybean interaction compared to SA pathway, which was not involved plant response to aphid in susceptible and antixenotic genotypes but played an important role in antibiosis one. Throughout, callose were deposited in all genotypes but it was more rapidly and efficiently in antibiotic one. However, reactive oxygen species were not involved in response to aphid attack in resistant genotypes during aphid infestation. Our study helps uncover important genes associated with aphid-attack response in antibiosis and antixenotic genotypes of soybean. Overall design: mRNA profiles of aphid-susceptible, antibiotic and antixenotic soybean genotypes in 24h, 48h and 96h after infestation generated using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform, in triplicate

abiotic	cadmium	NA	stress	SAMN14070098	PRJNA605520	root	NA	NA	Transcription Factor GmWRKY142 Confers Cadmium Resistance by Up-regulating the Cadmium Tolerance 1-like Genes	Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread pollutant that is toxic to living organisms. Previous studies have identified certain WRKY transcription factors, which confer Cd tolerance in different plant species. In the present study, we have identified 29 Cd-responsive WRKY genes in Edamame [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and confirmed that 26 of those GmWRKY genes were up-regulated, while 3 were down-regulated. We have also cloned the novel, positively regulated GmWRKY142 gene from soybean and investigated its regulatory mechanism in Cd tolerance. GmWRKY142 was highly expressed in the root, drastically up-regulated by Cd, localized in the nucleus, and displayed transcriptional activity. The overexpression of GmWRKY142 in Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean hairy roots significantly enhanced Cd tolerance and lead to extensive transcriptional reprogramming of stress-responsive genes. ATCDT1, GmCDT1-1, and GmCDT1-2 encoding cadmium tolerance 1 were induced in overexpression lines. Further analysis showed that GmWRKY142 activated the transcription of ATCDT1, GmCDT1-1, and GmCDT1-2 by directly binding to the W-box element in their promoters. In addition, the functions of GmCDT1-1 and GmCDT1-2, responsible for decreasing Cd uptake, were validated by heterologous expression in A. thaliana. Our combined results have determined GmWRKYs to be newly discovered participants in response to Cd stress, and have confirmed that GmWRKY142 directly targets ATCDT1, GmCDT1-1, and GmCDT1-2 to decrease Cd uptake and positively regulate Cd tolerance. The GmWRKY142-GmCDT1-1/2 cascade module provides a potential strategy to lower Cd accumulation in Edamame.

Three-day-old etiolated soybean seedlings were treated with gravitropic stimulation for 0, 1, or 12 h. Gravistimulation was carried out by rotating the plates with vertically grown seedlings. Harvested hypocotyls were separated into two parts, the lower side and the upper side, along the midline. At the indicated timepoints, the two sides of the hypocotyls were collected separately for RNA extraction and sequencing. Two biological replicates for each time point were prepared for RNA-seq analyses. HYDG means the cotyledons facing down and HYUG means the cotyledons facing up.

Currently, the common practice has been the investigation of compositional and nutritional substances in the GMO. However, unintended changes in the GMO might not be identified by the analysis of such small number of components. It is an evolving view among regulators that omics techniques, such as proteomics and metabolomics, can be used to complement analytical tools to existing safety assessment procedures. Therefore, this project is about the application of omics technologies to investigate potential unintended metabolic alterations in genetically modified plants and for elaboration of their relevance for GMO risk assessment. In particular, metabolic disturbances will be investigated when different transgenic inserts are combined in a single plant (stacking), and when these plants are exposed to abiotic stressors, such as herbicide application and drought. The project is divided into three working packages each containing experiments to address specific research questions.

These stress events have long-term impacts on plant performance and yield. It is imperative to improve our understanding of the genes and networks underlying plant stress tolerance to mitigate end of season yield loss. The majority of studies examining transcriptional changes induced by stress focus on single stress events. Few studies have been performed to examine the transcriptional response of plants exposed to sequential stress exposure, which better reflects field conditions. In this study, we examine the transcriptional profile of soybean plants exposed to iron deficiency stress followed by phosphate deficiency stress (-Fe-Pi). Comparing this response to previous studies, we identified a suite of genes unique to the novel sequential stress exposure (-Fe-Pi)
